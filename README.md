jQuery multInput
===================

jQuery multInput is a solution for adding multiple pieces of an item (single input field or collection of input elements) to a form.

Features include:
 *   adding / deleting new items
 *   ordering items
 *   configurable interface

Demos will be updated soon to show how powerful this simple plugin is. Yay!
